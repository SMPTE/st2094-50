## Details

In “Dynamic Metadata System for Color Volume Transform,” ST 2094-50 defines a
standardized framework that enables modern operating systems, image
compositors, and display pipelines to render multiple HDR and SDR sources -
text, graphics, images, and video within a common color-volume architecture.

The system anchors rendering behavior around an explicitly defined HDR
Reference White, carried within embedded dynamic metadata. By clearly
identifying Reference White, content creators gain the flexibility to establish
their intended artistic “look,” while also preserving perceptual intent across
displays with widely varying peak luminance capabilities.

ST 2094-50 addresses a long-standing challenge: consistent compositing of mixed
HDR and SDR elements. Until now, such workflows have either required manual
color management, been inconsistently implemented, or lacked predictable
behavior across platforms—including web browsers, consumer televisions, and
desktop displays. By standardizing dynamic color-volume transforms, ST 2094-50
provides a path toward interoperable, perceptually consistent HDR rendering in
heterogeneous display environments. We look forward to your comments.

**Implementers are encouraged to review the system and provide feedback as soon
as possible but no later than March 11, 2026, via GitHub, to help improve the
document and enhance interoperability across implementations.**
