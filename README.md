## Details

In “Dynamic Metadata System for Color Volume Transform,” ST 2094-50 defines a standardized framework that enables modern operating systems, image compositors, and display pipelines to render multiple HDR and SDR sources - text, graphics, images, and video within a common color-volume architecture.<br>

The system anchors rendering behavior around an explicitly defined HDR Reference White, carried within embedded dynamic metadata. By clearly identifying Reference White, content creators gain the flexibility to establish their intended artistic “look,” while also preserving perceptual intent across displays with widely varying peak luminance capabilities.<br>

ST 2094-50 addresses a long-standing challenge: consistent compositing of mixed HDR and SDR elements. Until now, such workflows have either required manual color management, been inconsistently implemented, or lacked predictable behavior across platforms—including web browsers, consumer televisions, and desktop displays. By standardizing dynamic color-volume transforms, ST 2094-50 provides a path toward interoperable, perceptually consistent HDR rendering in heterogeneous display environments. We look forward to your comments.<br>

**Implementers are encouraged to review the system and provide feedback as soon as possible but no later than October 17, 2025, via GitHub, to help improve the document and enhance interoperability across implementations.**
